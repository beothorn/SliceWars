Rules

Victory  
The game ends if a player conquer all territories or if a player has filled all his territories with 6 dice and has more than 50% of valid territories.

The game  
-Territory distribution  
The first player put a die on any territory. After that, the second player puts a die and so on until all territories are filles.

-Dice distribution  
After all territories are filled it's time to add dice to the territories. Starting with the first player, each player adds a die. This goes until every player added the sum of all territories divided by the number of players. Each territory can have a maximun of 6 dice.

-First round

The first player begins. He can attack other territories or pass his turn.  
A attack is made from a territory owned by the player to a territory connected to it. A attack can only happen if the attacking territory has more than one die.

--Attack  
An attack goes from one territory with two or more dice to an connected enemy territory. A territory without a owner has 7 dice, the player attacking throws the defense dice himself.  
In a attack, the player attacking and the player defending throw the dice of each territory and compare their sums.  
There can be three outcomes:  

Attacking sum greater than defense sum  
Attack wins. The attacking player moves all dice to the conquered territory, leaving one die behind. So, if he attacked with six dice, he leaves one die behind and moves five dice. The player can't choose to leave more than one dice.

Attacking sum equals defense sum OR defense sum greater than attack sum   
Defense wins. The attacking territory loses all it's dice except one. For example, if the attacker had 5 dice attacking 3 dice and the sum of the 5 dice values is less than the defending three dice, the territory that had 5 dice is left with only one. The defending territory keeps it's three dice. It's important to notice that territories with only one die can't attack. 

The turn ends when the player chooses to pass. The round continues until all player have played.

--Second round  
From the second round on the game mechanics don't change. Before playing the player adds a number of dice equivalent to the biggest group of connected territories he owns. For example, if the player owns 9 territories but only 3 of those are connected, he gets 3 dice.  
The player must add all dice to the territories of his choice. If all is territories are alread filled with six dice, the remaining dice are discarded. After adding all dice te player can attack or pass his turn.

The game proceeds until someone wins.
